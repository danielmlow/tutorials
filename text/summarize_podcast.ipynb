      "Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is Dr Peter Attia. Dr. Peter Attia is a medical doctor who did his training at Stanford University, School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Dr. Atia is one of the world's most trusted voices on the topics of healthspan and Lifespan, and with good reason. He is known to systematically review the research literature, the clinical trials, and he maintains an avid clinical practice. So when it comes to the topic of whether or not a particular molecule or supplement or prescription drug is indeed something that we should be thinking about and perhaps even taking in order to improve our health span and Lifespan, Dr.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (50s):\n",
      "Attia is the person that I choose to sit down with and discuss it. So today we are going to discuss the so-called NAD pathway. This is a pathway that's received a lot of attention in recent years as a potential target for improving Lifespan that is for living longer. Today, we discuss the various molecules in this pathway and the various approaches to increasing NAD, which is the N target goal of anyone that's trying to augment the NAD pathway, so to speak. So for instance, we talk about taking and NR versus NMN versus direct infusions, or even orally taking NAD. And we compare them in terms of both what's known and what is not known about their ability to get into cells and any efficacy they may have for either Longevity or health span.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (1m 38s):\n",
      "Dr. att and I compare and contrast the literature on this, again, both research and clinical literature, and we discuss whether or not he or I take NAD, NMN or and NR, and if so, or if not the reasons for that. We also each go through our own supplement regimen, which of course reflects what we do believe can potentially have an effect on healthspan and or Lifespan. So by the end of today's episode, you'll learn a lot about NAD. You'll learn a lot about the biological pathway. You'll learn a lot about the delivery routes, the various supplements, and why people think they may be useful, why others, perhaps even Dr. Atiya and myself think they may not be useful for Longevity. You'll have to listen to find out what the answer is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2m 19s):\n",
      "I should also mention that we give somewhat of an overview or a framework for thinking about approaches to Longevity. So if you're interested in things like rapamycin, metformin, and whether or not fasting can improve Longevity, we get into that as well. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the Sponsors of today's podcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "LMNT (2m 48s):\n",
      "Our first Sponsor is element. Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar. Now, proper hydration is critical for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body, and that's especially true for the neurons, the nerve cells. In fact, we know that even a slight degree of dehydration can diminish both cognitive and physical performance. So to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration in electrolytes, I personally dissolve one packet of element in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I first wake up in the morning, and I drink that or sip that across the first half hour of the day or so. And then I also make it a point to drink another packet of element dissolved in an equal amount of water. So 16 to 32 ounces at some other point during the day, and maybe even a third if I'm exercising and or sweating a lot, I should mention the element tastes absolutely delicious. My favorite flavor is watermelon, although I also confess I like the raspberry flavor, the citrus flavor. Basically, I like all the flavors. If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drink element.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with the purchase of any element drink mix. Again, that's drink element.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack.\n",

      "Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods impact your health by giving you real-time feedback on your diet using a continuous Glucose monitor. One of the most important factors in both short and long-term health is your body's ability to manage blood Glucose to maintain optimal energy and focus throughout the day. You want to keep your blood Glucose levels steady without big spikes or crashes. I first started using levels about three years ago as a way to try and understand how different foods impact my blood Glucose levels And. It's proven incredibly useful for determining what food choices I should make when best to eat certain foods, especially around things like workouts and when and what to eat relative to when I go to sleep in order to allow for the best possible night's sleep and stable blood sugar throughout the night and when I wake up in the morning. So if you're interested in learning more about levels and trying A CGM yourself, go to Levels Link slash huberman levels recently launched a new CGM sensor that's even smaller and has even better tracking than their previous version. Right now, they're also offering an additional two free months of membership. Again, that's levels link spelled LINK slash huberman to try the new sensor and two free months of membership.\n",

      "Eight Sleep (5m 10s):\n",
      "Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep Eight. Sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity. Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts of quality sleep each night. One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment. And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep, your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees. And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized, your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees. Eight Sleep makes it incredibly easy to control the temperature of your sleeping environment by allowing you to program the temperature of your mattress cover at the beginning, middle, and end of the night. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for well over three years now. And, it has completely transformed my sleep for the better. Eight. Sleep recently launched their newest generation pod cover, the POD four Ultra. The POD four Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity, higher fidelity sleep tracking technology And. it also has snoring detection that remarkably will automatically lift your head a few degrees to improve your airflow and stop your snoring. If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover, you can go to Eight Sleep dot com slash huberman to save $350 off their pod. Four Ultra Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA Canada, UK select countries in the EU and Australia. Again, that's Eight Sleep dot com slash huberman.\n",

      "Do you mind if I set up a little bit of a framework? Great. So for people that want to live as long as possible, I figure there are at least four categories of approaches, broadly speaking. The first, I'll just call the do's and don'ts. You've talked a lot about these. Your book outlive beautifully covered these, and I tend to regurgitate some of what you say on this podcast. Namely, you wanna move appropriately and often enough. So get enough zone two cardio. Do your resistance training. Keep nerve to muscle connection strong. Avoid the sorts of things that would lead to falling and being immobile.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (7m 32s):\n",
      "Eat right. There's a whole category of things there we're not gonna talk about today, although we might touch on a bit and Know your genetics and make some good decisions on the basis of your genetics. So the do's and don'ts, the second category I would put under the umbrella of calories, Glucose, insulin, et cetera, that all kind of funnel in, at least in my mind, to mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin, a molecule that's robustly expressed during development, and essentially all cells of the body. And then across the Lifespan, tapers off during puberty especially, well, let's say infancy through puberty, cells are expressing so much mTOR and they're growing like crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (8m 21s):\n",
      "And we often associate that early stage of life as youth, not Aging, because we think of it as a, a kind of a timestamp as opposed to the verb. But I would argue as a developmental neurobiologist by training that it's one of the most rapid phases of Aging, of our entire Lifespan. Look at a picture of you when you were five. Look at a picture of you when you were eight versus 15. You look very different, and your size is robustly different.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (8m 49s):\n",
      "By the way, I just did this exercise, 'cause my daughter, her birth, her 16th birthday is around the corner and we take a picture of her every single year at the minute of her birth. So we have a picture of her every single year holding a clock that says 3 56 at 3:56 PM because that's when she was born. And I just went through and pulled each of the last 16 of them from the day she was born all the way up. And you're right, the biggest changes are actually in about the first 10 years. You know, the difference between being 13 and 14, 14 and 15, 15 and 16 becomes incrementally less and less and less. Whereas going from two to three and three to four and four to five are ridiculous changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (9m 30s):\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, the brain, the same brain has to learn an entirely new body every year in terms of how to move it, limb length, et cetera. So a lot of the, so-called anti-aging or Longevity approaches that fall under this umbrella relate to things like Caloric Restriction or taking drugs such as Rapamycin, And. of course, mammalian target of rapamycin is the target of Rapamycin. Duh. In an effort to essentially remove excess insulin, blood Glucose and thereby Reduce mTOR activity. So essentially slow cellular growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (10m 12s):\n",
      "And all that fits nicely into the logic that mTOR is associated, not just with development, but with Aging because development is Aging. And then I would say there's a third category, and it's the one we are going to talk about today, which is targeting specific cellular pathways that some people have deemed potentially interesting for Longevity. And the pathway that we're going to spend some time on is the, so-called NAD pathway, and NR NMN, NAD being the major players. And we'll talk about some of the biochemical and enzymatic steps in between. And then I suppose there's a fourth category, which we could say is, you know, the do everything, even the most esoteric of things category, this is a rare category.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (10m 55s):\n",
      "There are folks like Brian Johnson who spend a lot of time in this category specifically, you know, taking very high Doses of polyphenols, limiting their caloric intake to just early part of the day. I think he eats dinner at 11:00 AM I don't know if it still qualifies as dinner at 11:00 AM but his final bite of calories is, I believe at 11:00 AM doing everything from red light to PR ppl, platelet, platelet rich plasma, excuse me, and essentially the kitchen sink approach to Longevity and Aging. Did I miss any categories?\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (11m 31s):\n",
      "So I I, I would frame it slightly differently because I, I like categories to be more mey, mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive. So, so I, I don't, I don't know that I would formulate it that way, right? I might say, look, category one are sort of the essential behavioral things that you have no choice but to engage in whether you want to or not, right? So you have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to move, you just have a choice in do you wanna do those things correctly or not correctly? Or do you wanna do those things in a manner that promotes health or erodes health, right? So again, there's nobody listening to us who doesn't eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (12m 13s):\n",
      "But again, you can choose how much you eat and what you eat. And when you eat, there's nobody who's alive who isn't moving because locomotion is life. And the absence of life is the absence of locomotion. But you can certainly choose to move very little. You can choose to move a lot, and you can choose to decide on how you move. You alluded to it already, right? You can, you can move in a certain way that puts your aerobic system in a zone that maximizes fat oxidation. We call that zone two. You can move at a level where you consume incredible amounts of oxygen at your maximum aerobic level. You can choose to move in a manner that uses resistance and, and gravity against you and all those sorts of things. Similarly, we all have to sleep, right? Matt Walker would probably tell us the number of days you could go with sleep without sleep before you would literally perish.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (12m 57s):\n",
      "But again, you have a lot of choices in how you do it. So anyway, I agree that's kind of category one, but that's kinda the way I would frame it. And then I would put in category two, sort of what are the molecules that you would exogenously take to try to impact any of those systems? And maybe, and again, I'm not saying my framework is correct and yours isn't. I'm just saying, this is the way I think about it. I would then say, what are the molecules that I could take that specifically target disease processes? So I kind of think of like, if you want to live longer, and I described this I think in chapter four of outlive, there's a, that's a, that turns out to be mathematically equivalent in the modern society to delaying the onset of chronic disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (13m 42s):\n",
      "Now, that wasn't true a hundred years ago. A hundred years ago, if you wanted to live longer, a few things had to be true. You couldn't die during childbirth and that 'cause that was a huge hit on mortality. And then you had to not get an infection or succumb to trauma. And, and then maybe 150 years ago that was the case. But today, most of those things are taken care of by antibiotics, sanitation, and, you know, the modern miracle of childbirth in the, in, in, in this era. So now for you and I to live longer, we basically have to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, dementing diseases, and metabolic diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (14m 24s):\n",
      "We have to delay the onset of those things. The longer we delay the onset, the longer we will live full stop. So you can use everything that you talked about in the first category plays into that. But you also have this other category of where you can take molecules that specifically target those things. You can take metformin or an SGLT two inhibitor or a GLP one agonist, and you will directly impact those things. You could take a PCSK nine inhibitor or a statin or bem aoic acid, you will directly impact those disease processes. You will delay the onset of those diseases and you will reduce the mortality associated with them. Then I'm gonna go to a third category that says, are there exogenous molecules that you can take that don't target a disease per se specifically, but we're gonna put them in a category called jero protective, which is they target hallmarks and pathways of Aging that you've described.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (15m 18s):\n",
      "So we talk about all of these things that occur in an Aging phenotype where we see more Inflammation, we see a greater abundance of senescent cells, we see reduced nutrient sensing capacity of mTOR, which you describe as the probably the most important nutrient sensing system in our body. So, so we have, you know, these, somewhere between nine and 14. The number just keeps changing arbitrarily, but it doesn't really matter. We have these central things that everybody would agree, define what an Aging phenotype is, and can we use exogenous molecules to target those specifically. You gave one example, which I, I would argue is the single best example, which is Rapamycin.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (16m 1s):\n",
      "So rapamycin targets a very specific hallmark of Aging, and we can talk about what the experimental evidence is to suggest that that makes you live longer. So I would sort of say those are the big three categories. And then basically the fourth category you could just say is like, how do you put them all together and how aggressive do you want to be in culminating those? Of course, none of this touches on another area that I wanna talk about, that we won't talk about today, which is like, how does all that factor into kind of emotional health and happiness and, and and wellbeing where, you know, none of none of this other stuff matters if you're kind of unhappy. And so, so you have to, and and you've done so many podcasts on that topic, right? You've had Paul Conte on where you kind of go through the understanding of ourselves and our minds and, and why that's also a very important part of it, because it actually does impact how long you live.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (16m 47s):\n",
      "Because if that piece isn't working, it's very difficult to regulate the first bucket. 'cause the first bucket takes so much work. So if you can't regulate yourself, it's very difficult to regulate the, the do's and don'ts. But even absent just length of life stuff, it impacts quality of life, which is this idea of health span as well. So I guess that's just my slightly different way to frame it, but it's a little bit more mey in that, you know, we talk about the behaviors, the exogenous molecules that target diseases, the exogenous molecules that target Aging,\n",

      "Aside from food, what exogenous molecules do you take?\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (17m 29s):\n",
      "I take a few, right? So I take some that are disease specific, right? So I take a PCSK nine inhibitor, I take mpad doic acid, I take an SGLT two inhibitor, and then I take at least one that is purely just based on the belief of its capacity in Jira protection, which is RIS rapamycin. And, and also the sgl s the SGLT two inhibitor I think is probably just broadly jero protective. And we can even talk about that a little bit in terms of the success of one of those molecules called canagliflozin in the Interventions, Testing Program, the ITP, which I am sure we'll talk about in the context of NAD as well.\n",

      "Yeah, I mean, you, you know, and this'll be an important theme today, right? It's like we can talk all day long about mechanisms and theoretical arguments for why it would work. And I think my conviction around taking rapamycin is less about sort of looking at the molecular explanation for why rapa works. Although I find that to be quite convincing. And why does the inhibition of mTOR stimulate autophagy? Why would that suppress senescent cells? But truthfully, my conviction around mTOR is far more based on the experimental data, something that is actually sorely lacking in the NAD story, which we'll discuss. So the experimental data are far more convincing, right?\n",

So looking at mammals such as mice and small primates, looking at fruit flies, looking at worms, and even looking at Yeast, although that's so far from us that you would argue that's the least important. You see something that you don't see for a single other molecule, which is uniform life extension. No other molecule has done this.\n",

And I've often said to my patients, look, in 2026, I'm either gonna feel a lot more conviction about taking rapamycin and prescribing it to some of my patients, though again, not most, or I'm gonna, you know, have a second look at this and say, you know, maybe, maybe we just shouldn't be taking this, right?\n",

And then actually a group of us raised that money for Matt and did that so great. Me and a so few of my patients and a couple of other folks came together and put the money in to close the gap. But yes, there has been, what, what's what, what did get pulled back by the NIH inexplicably and in, in my view totally incorrectly, was the ongoing surveillance program, the funding for the ongoing surveillance program that would allow this type of work to continue and to allow greater follow up on this.\n",

But anyway, we could have a whole other journal club discussion about funding. But I, I had to ask, I was curious.

My intuition is, I I I, I've never looked to be honest with you, but given that red blood cells have a different metabolic pathway, right, where they're purely glycolytic, I don't, they wouldn't have the need for it in the way that others would, but they might, right?

And most of what it does, and I mean most meaning like somewhere between five and 600 pathways of it utilize NAD as a co-factor, meaning that it's not consumed in a chemical reaction, but rather it serves as an electron shuttle. So NAD and NADH basically play catch with electrons, and that's 99% of what NAD is doing in the body. And for that reason, NAD is so tightly regulated in the body.\n",

If it's below seven or above 7.8 on a zero to 14 scale, we die full stop. So similarly, NAD is managed across all ages and across all physiologic conditions in a super tight band. There's another place where NAD shows up and that shows up as a substrate, right?\n",

It was some experiments where the Sirtuins were mutated in one direction or the other, meaning gain a function or loss of function. These days people heal, gain a function and they immediately think to pandemic related themes. But gain of function is a way of changing genes typically to augment a function, increase its robustness, or in some cases, to rescue a phenotype where you have a knockout mouse that lacks a gene. So that's loss of function or a strain of Yeast that lacks a gene. And then you do the gain of function rescue experiment. You re reintroduce the, the gene of interest.\n",

But gain of function and loss of function, assuming that the results jive tells you much, much more. This is one of the major areas I think this is very important to highlight where human genetics really struggles. Because you can get humans with a mutation in a particular pathway. Like, I don't know the sonic hedgehog pathway. They're somebody is hypomorphic for sonic hedgehog and you know, they might actually lack a, a major tooth up in the middle because the role of sonic hedgehog at the midline. And you could say, okay, well loss of function here, here's the role of sonic hedgehog.\n",

Because as any logical mind can tell, there could be many things downstream of sonic hedgehog that could create the phenotype that you observe. But if you put sonic hedgehog back in, yes that's still true, but you get more reassurance that that's the gene of interest. So with respect to Sirtuins, as I recall, they deleted the Sirtuins. Yeah. So\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (29m 12s):\n",
      "Let's use another example of what the gold standard is here or what a great example is. So, so I recently did a podcast with Dina Al from UCSF on Clotho, which is a, an amazing scientific story. And it's a great story because it shows how accidents can lead to great discoveries. So there is a, a researcher in Japan who is really interested in understanding hypertension, high blood pressure. And they had created a mouse model where they were trying to Knock out certain sodium channels to see if they could perturb blood pressure. And then there was this one strain of mouse with this one knockout that died really, really quickly And, it developed like devastating neurogenerative disease and died very quickly. And you know, like a good scientist, he didn't say, well that sucks, I'm gonna discard that one 'cause it didn't give me what I wanted, which was the blood pressure change.\n",

      "2 (29m 56s):\n",
      "And he kind of went and figured out what was going on and he figured out that there was a certain gene that he had hit that wasn't a sodium transporter and instead was this other gene. He named it clotho. So, so you had this one piece of evidence right now, which was if you Knock out that gene, you kill an animal very quickly. Now that doesn't mean it's a Longevity gene, you have to do the other experiment. To your point, you have to over express that gene and ask the question, do you live longer? And sure enough, when they overexpressed that same gene that they had just knocked out and killed the mouse, the thing was living 15 to 20% longer.\n",

To be clear, I don't take AG one because they're a Sponsor, rather, they are a Sponsor because I take AG one. In fact, I take AG one once and often twice every single day. And I've done that since starting way back in 2012. There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays about what proper nutrition is. But here's what, there seems to be a general consensus on whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore, a vegetarian, or a vegan. I think it's generally agreed that you should get most of your food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources, which allows you to eat enough but not overeat. Get plenty of vitamins and minerals, probiotics and micronutrients that we all need for physical and mental health. Now I personally am an omnivore and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed or minimally processed sources. But the reason I still take AG one once and often twice every day is that it ensures I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera, but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress. It's basically a nutritional insurance policy meant to augment, not replace quality food. So by drinking a serving of AG one in the morning, and again in the afternoon or evening, I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs. And I like so many other people that take AG one report feeling much better in a number of important ways such as Energy, Levels, digestion, sleep, and more. So while many supplements out there are really directed towards obtaining one specific outcome, AG one is foundational nutrition designed to support all aspects of wellbeing related to mental health and physical health. If you'd like to try AG one, you can go to drink AG one.com/huberman to claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs with your order plus a year supply of vitamin D three K two.

      "So let's go to the Sirtuin story. So it goes back to the late nineties, Matt Caplin again, this is amazing, right? So you have this guy who's like the leading authority or one of the leading authorities on the, on the work going on today with rapamycin, along with one of his colleagues, David Sabatini and a few others. But when, when Matt was a postdoc, he did an experiment in a strain of mice, pardon me, a strain of Yeast, I think it was the W 3 0 3 strain of Yeast. And he over expressed SIR two, and lo and behold, the Yeast lived longer. Now, a year later, someone else in the same lab took a different strain of Yeast and calorically restricted them.\n",

      "And they also lived longer. I forget the name of that, I forget what that strain was. It was something three 16 was, it was a different strain of Yeast at that moment. Again, this is about 25 years ago, a hypothesis emerged, which was we have two different strains of Yeast. And in one of them, when you over express SIR two, this gene, they live longer. And in this other strain, if you calorically restrict them, they live longer. The understandable hypothesis was Caloric Restriction, which we had known was life extending, is working through Sirtuins. That hypothesis sort of fell apart about four years later when Matt Capin again this time with Brian Kennedy did another experiment in a different, yet a third strain of Yeast that allowed them to test hypothesis.\n",

When you took the 3 0 3 strain, this is the strain that when over expressing SIR two lived longer, if you took that strain and you calorically calorically restricted them, no change, that's odd. Even more odd is when you took the three 16 strain, and this is the strain that lived longer with cr, if you over express SIR two, no change. So right off the bat, the story didn't make sense, but it was further solidified that that story didn't make sense when Brian and Matt published in 2004 and yet a different strain, God, I'm blanking on the name, it's like BBY 47 42.\n",

      "Like you know, these don't matter if you calorically restricted them, they lived longer if you overexpressed sir. Two, they lived longer. If you did both, they lived even longer. It was additive again, further suggesting that overexpression of SIR two and Caloric Restriction independently and separately extended Lifespan. These are parallel pathways. They're parallel pathways for reasons that honestly escape me. Andrew, there are still people who maintain that the benefit of sirtuin overexpression is through the Caloric Restriction pathway and vice versa.\n",

My reading of the literature, in addition to every person I have talked to on this who works in the space, including Matt Kalin, who has done the most research on this, is that there is no evidence that Caloric, Restriction and Sirtuins operate through the same pathway.

Like it's just, it's, yeah, Caloric Restriction, which by the way, there are real debates about whether it will extend life in humans because it will clearly, I shouldn't say clearly. I think it would be a very safe bet that severe Caloric Restriction will absolutely reduce the risk of most chronic diseases. Meaning I, I have, I think there's very good reason to believe that if an individual constituently consumed 25% fewer calories than they were meant to eat, their risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease would go down.

So you trade one set of diseases for another, it's not at all clear that Lifespan goes up. And by the way, when you even look at some of the wild, like some of the animal literature where they're using different strains of mice that are not inbred and they don't put them in hermetically sealed situations, they don't live longer. So it's not always the case that Caloric Restriction extends life. And therefore, while it's safe to say Caloric Restriction probably reduces the onset of chronic disease that might not translate to an all cause mortality benefit based on those downsides.\n",

Caloric Restriction, we've got this thing, which you know, for 50 years we've known has a signal that really says it's life extending and we've got this Yeast where it works and this other Yeast where sirtuin activation works. Oh, it's gotta be sort.

But it's, as you pointed out, an additive effect seems like a pretty straightforward experiment to do. You could just do an occlusion, right? You could of course then put back in the CER two and or adjust calories and see whether or not you get the, effectively whether the math is corrected. Yeah. You know, so\n",

So we have to now simultaneously start to hold things true in parallel that may or may not be true.

So in that case, you still get some normal expression of the gene from the endogenous genome. But now you have a transgene that's inserted there. And there are all sorts of important intricacies that relate to this. For instance, where the transgene is inserted, if it's, you know, downstream of, of an enhancer that's muscle specific, then you can get a mouse that it over expresses cerin just in muscle.

Again, to be clear, the females didn't experience a difference. And that's not uncommon or unheard of in Longevity research. There generally are sex specific differences and you always have to read the fine print. The first thing I always look at in a study when I see a difference in sexes, or frankly any difference in Longevity, but it's always great when they parse them out by sexes, is how long did the controls live?

It is probably true that in a handful of strains of Yeast, if you over express cert, you are going to live longer. That tends to be completely independent of Caloric Restriction. That's the single thing I can say with the greatest confidence. And there is at least one transgenic strain of mice that if you get it to over express a different cert, cert six. But again, they're, these are homologs throughout the species. So we don't have to get, I don't think we need to get wrapped up in cert two versus cert six.

So the soluble products of senescent cells, so, so tamp, so in other words, those are all three good things, right?

      "Well, I mean, I think we, we know that as we age, it's just a stochastic process, right? Like given the ubiquity of DNA replication and the fidelity of the system, which is high, very high, but not perfect, there's going to be mistakes. Actually, this is an interesting question. So in 2016, I went to Easter Island with David Saini and Nav Chenell and Tim Ferriss. So the four of us just took a trip to Easter Island to see the birthplace of rapamycin. So it was kind of like vacation slash science journey.\n",

      "It was awesome. And you know, so just picture hiking around this incredible island just talking about science all day. But this was an interesting question that I posed to nav and to David, which was, why do we see such a clear and present association with cancer as we age? And why is it so non-linear? So it's not just that cancer goes up with age, it goes up like that. And I said, I'll offer two hypotheses, which is more compelling. Is it simply that as we're Aging DNA replication, again, taking a step back for the listener, cancer is a genetic disease, meaning by definition, it, it is sort of, the canonical problem with cancer is a genetic mutation that leads to two properties of a cell, the inability of the cell to rep to control replication.\n",

      "So it interrupts cell signaling. So cells replicate, but then don't know when to stop. And then the introduction of the capacity to spread the, this property called metastases, those are the two hallmarks of cancer. So, so we know that that only happens in the context of genetic mutations, but why does this happen later in life and not at the beginning of life with very few exceptions. And, and so the question is, is it because over time mutations compound? Is it because there are more mutations as we age or is there a third issue? Which is all of those things are happening normally and they're no more abundant when you're 80 than when you're 20, but your immune system can't detect them as well.\n",

      "And the truth of it is, we didn't come up with an answer, but it's probably all of the above. So it's probably that as we are Aging, we are undergoing more DNA damage and or at a minimum the DNA damage we're undergoing is less amenable to repair. And that's part of the thesis here. Part of the thesis here is as we are Aging, we are less and less able to repair DNA. And one of the arguments that put forth, although we have, we're not quite ready for this part of the story yet, but I'll just say it now and we'll come back to it, is we don't have enough of the substrate that the sirtuin needs to repair DNA and that substrate is NAD.

Not consuming NAD, just using it to pass electrons back and forth. But then over here we have this other category where we use NAD as a substrate, it gets broken down, and that's what the Sirtuins are doing to repair DNA. Okay? So if that's true, and if NAD levels are declining with age, it's a logical conclusion that should we give more NAD, right? If you're running outta substrate to repair DNA and DNA repair is an important way to thwart Aging.\n",

      "It all makes sense. So we'll keep that over there. But before we do, I wanna come back to one other story, which is the story of sirtuin activators. So what's the most famous sirtuin activator of all time? What is the heavyweight champion of sirtuin activators that has taken up 99% of the bandwidth in this space? It's a lovely little chemical called Resveratrol. Okay? So Resveratrol, which gained a lot of fame and notoriety because it happens to be found in trace elements in the skin of grapes, and therefore shows up in wine, gained a lot of notoriety. About 20 years ago when one lab doing one experiment, somehow was able to convince some people, including a very large pharma company, that Resveratrol increased Lifespan.\n",

It improves mitochondrial biogenesis, it's suppresses senescent cells, And it, it, it enhances DNA repair. So if you have something that is such a potent activator of Sirtuins and you give it to a mouse, that mouse should live longer. Now, lots of experiments were done that couldn't find that, but one experiment was done. But it was a, it was an interesting experiment. I've discussed this at least on two podcasts, including one with Rich Miller who runs the ITP, the Interventions Testing Program, which later tested Resveratrol and found that it did categorically nothing in this one experiment that worked.\n",

So the mouse died prematurely because they couldn't breathe. And in that particular mouse model, Resveratrol rescued the mice. So again, let's just assume that all of that is correct, and it's possible that there were even errors there, but let's just assume that's correct. Let's assume, so\n",

There was this period of time when people thought this was the explanation to the French paradox, right? Why on average do the French live longer when they consume so much wine? And the answer was, it's got to be the Resveratrol. Turns out that's not true at all, because yeah, you would need to be drinking your body weight and wine a day to get the Doses of Resveratrol that were needed to produce this effect. But for whatever reason, there was an effect, which is if the thing that was going to kill you was your liver being so full of fat that it shot up into your chest so you couldn't breathe, which I've never seen a human no matter how bad their fatty liver has been, where that's been the case.\n",

But again, it turned out that there was no other replication of this in mouse models that matter. And that always comes back to the ITP, the Interventions Testing Program, which is the most robust tool we have scientifically to measure these exogenous molecules. So the ITP is an NIA funded program that runs out of three independent labs. And by independent, I mean they're each doing the experiments independently, but they're, they're in sync with doing the experiment, but they're doing it in triplicate. So you have three labs, three great labs doing the experiments in triplicate.\n",

And that res result has been consistent across the board. So that's also a very important part of the story, which was, if Resveratrol was a sirtuin activator, and I don't know if it really is, it clearly has no effect on Lifespan with the one little asterisk that says, unless your body weight is 50% fatty liver, then maybe it does.\n",

      "Right. Like, what's going on? Right. So, right. You and I ate something at some point in the foreseeable past that contained chemical energy. So we ate something that was organic. So it had, so primarily fats and carbohydrates contain carbon, carbon bonds and carbon hydrogen bonds. And those bonds contain a ton of energy. But how do we liberate the energy? So we break it all down into these constitutive molecules, namely Glucose on the carbohydrate front and free fatty acids on the fat front. And then our bodies break those things down further into smaller molecules that get shuttled into the mitochondria where the lions share of our energy liberation comes from.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (58m 16s):\n",
      "And what we do is we take that chemical energy that is stored in a carbon tocar bond, or a carbon to hydrogen bond, and we turn it into electrical energy. And people have heard this term, it's called the electron transport chain. So there are these four complexes in the mitochondria, and there's an inner membrane in an outer membrane across which these mitochondrial, these large mitochondrial complexes reside. And what they're doing is they're building up a huge electron gradient by sh by breaking them apart and taking the electrons and transferring them between NAD and NADH so that at the end they can do another trick, which is transfer those electrons to A-M-P-A-D-P and ultimately make a TP.\n",

      "The finished product is water and carbon dioxide. So we eat and we take that chemical energy and food, we utilize oxygen in the mitochondria to make a TP carbon dioxide, which we breathe out and water, which we breathe and pee out. So what NAD and NADH are doing is playing an absolutely essential to life role in facilitating the transfer of chemical energy to electrical energy, back to chemical energy. A TP is just taking it from one chemical form in food to the electrical form is the intermediary in the mitochondria back to an electrical form of a TP.\n",

So yeah, this, this whole NAD NADH thing is like, you know, it's central to our existence as any form of respiration. So my point, let's go back to the story. The story was NAD levels are going down as we age, but NADH levels are going up suggesting that the total amount of NAD and NADH is the same. And what's declining as we age should less be thought of as a reduction in NAD and should more be thought of as a reduction in what's called redox potential.\n",

So when people say NAD levels decline with Aging, the answer is Yeah, but what's really declining as we age, and this kind of comes back to what you said at the very, very outset, like what's happening at the cellular level, I think what's happening is our mitochondria are not as good as we age, and we have less redox potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (1h 0m 43s):\n",
      "And I would say a fair number of, so-called anti-aging approaches are targeting the, so-called Reactive Oxygen Species R oss, which impede mitochondrial function. Essentially, this is an opportunity for me to call out the work that I think is at least intriguing, which is the work of a colleague by the name of Glenn Jeffrey at the University of College London. He's been in the field of visual neuroscience for a very long time. And a few years back he started doing some experiments on animals. And now also two studies published on humans showing that exposing the aged eye, so 40 and older to red light and near infrared light for a couple minutes, a few times a week, can spare certain processes involved in vision photoreceptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (1h 1m 33s):\n",
      "How does this work? Well, the idea, this isn't proven yet. The idea is that it's reducing Reactive, Oxygen, Species and thereby improving mitochondrial function in what is perhaps the most metabolically active cell type in the entire body, not just the eye, which are the photoreceptors. Hmm. So it's an intriguing set of studies. Again, we don't have all the mechanisms worked out, but it brings us around again, to this idea that mitochondria are vitally important for the functioning of cells. Things that impede the function of mitochondria can either reduce the output of and or kill cells. And so anything that can improve redux can potentially keep a cell around longer functioning better.\n",

That might not be so straightforward. Right? I mean, I don't wanna jump to supplementation just yet, but if we are to back up from NAD a little bit and look at the pathway leading to NAD, it's and NR, NMN and NAD, we'll spell these out in a moment.

We believe supplementing NAD in one form or another makes sense. But before we do that, we should acknowledge something. Yes, NAD levels are going down, but we have no reason to believe that raising NAD levels will correct a problem. In other words, if the body operates between this level and this level of NAD, and if you go below this level, you die and you go above this level, you die and levels as you age go like this.\n",

Number three is this matters in our species. The species of interest, leap of faith. Four is, you know, the whole sirtuin activator thing.

The ITP is hands down the most rigorous tool we have for testing molecules in anything other than the species of interest. Because we can't do these experiments in human, we cannot test Lifespan interventions in humans for the obvious reasons. So what is the next best thing?

When you give rapamycin, the first time they did it, because they had a hard time formulating the rapamycin, they weren't able to start it until the mice were like 21 months old, which is very old for a mouse. That's like a 60-year-old mouse. And at that point, they almost aborted the experiment because they were like, well, what's the point? Nothing is gonna work when you start this late, including Caloric Restriction, by the way. Although it has worked in one experiment. But nevertheless, it worked. And when you gave rapa that late in life, it still worked. Then they redid the experiment and they gave it earlier it worked. Canagliflozin, as I mentioned, which is an SGLT two inhibitor.\n",

But then the, but the, but the treatment mice weren't any lighter than the non-treatment mice. Which actually goes back to something you said at the very outset, which suggested that tight glycemic control, independent of weight, is a Longevity benefit. The same was true with the SGLT two inhibitor. Canagliflozin SGLT two inhibitors cause you to pee out more. Glucose a carbo prevents you from absorbing in your gut.\n",

So terra still bean is believed to be a sirtuin activator like Resveratrol. So commercially available product called basis And. it was tested. There was a, it was a three arm study in humans, roughly 30 people per arm. So decent sized study, right? This is a big study. So you take a hundred people, more or less with Fatty, Liver, Disease.

So, so, you know, you start with just fat accumulating in the liver, but as more and more fat accumulates, you start to get Inflammation that results in scarring and fibrosis. And ultimately you would get to cirrhosis. So just keep it in the back of your mind, the threshold at which we would say you're, you're in the, you're, you're, you're, you're in the danger zone is once you hit 5%.

They also looked at something called the, they, they looked at many things, right? So they looked at all sorts of biomarkers. And the primary outcome for the study was, did you see a reduction of this hepatic fat via the MRI? So what happened? So they, they did the study and lo and behold, there was no difference.

'cause a sub-analysis is not a primary outcome, but it's a kind of a, a way to go and parse the data. And they did find one statistically, one statistically significant finding, which was if you limited the analysis to people who had a hepatic fat score below 27%, remember I said once you're above 5%, you're, you're sort of, you have Fatty, Liver, Disease.\n",

If you limited the analysis to people who had below 27% on this hepatic fat index, the people who got the full dose had no difference. They averaged 20% at the beginning of the trial and 19% at the end. No statistically significant difference. The placebo group averaged 20% at the beginning, 20% at the end.\n",

So generic forms are inexpensive enough that nobody, believe it or not, they're not, this is the irony of it is, is generic. So Rapamune is the brand drug that was initially approved in 1999. And today if you go and buy rapamycin, you're gonna not buy Rapamune. You're gonna probably buy generic sirolimus or rapamycin. And yet it's surprisingly quite expensive. Now it's not enormously expensive 'cause you're not taking much of it, but it's about five bucks a milligram. That's pretty expensive.

But the point is like nobody has a commercial interest in rapamycin. Right. It's sort of an irrelevant drug. It's, but the interest is scientific. Right. And, and, and the commercial interest is in what we call rapa logs, which are analogs of rapamycin that are being investigated by a number of companies to, to look at new indications. For example, immunity, Immune Function. Right.

Which again was, for me that was the turning point, right? That's when rapamycin went from something that was interesting based on the first ITP in 2009 to maybe we should be taking this in 2014. So between 2009 and 2014, I was kind of looking at the curiosity of Rapamycin and saying, well cool that it worked in mice.\n",

But if you just pulse it once a week, as they did in that study, it seems to improve Immune Function, which again means it's an immune modulator, it can go up or down in the immune system. That was really the, the hypothesis that emerged from that experiment. And so now the question is could you design drugs that are more specific to emptor complex one, which rapamycin is not.

'cause we both live at sea level. So just ambient Radiation living at sea level is one milli seaver a year. Okay? So we just chewed up 2% of our annual allocation.

If you got it done at a place that's sort of average might be 10 to 15 milli seavers, pardon me, per scan. Now here's what's really interesting, by the way, I'm, I'm totally fascinated by this question, which is how much Radiation is too much a DEXA scan, by the way, you can't even measure how many milli seavers you're getting.

So A DMA and SDMA regulate nitric oxide synthase and homocysteine impairs their clearance. And therefore when you have high levels of homocysteine, it par it, it results ultimately in impaired nitric oxide synthase and therefore low no nitric oxide.

'cause that's a known right, if you, if your kidneys don't work well, your risk of car heart disease goes way up. So this is now proposed as a link between what we observe with homocysteine and impaired renal function. So we know that if you take methylfolate and methyl B12, you're gonna lower homocysteine.

And it's a really interesting story how they kind of develop this and how difficult it is to actually make an anaerobic bacteria. And so this is kind of an odd company 'cause it's a supplement company, but they have to basically adhere to pharma GMP conditions to make it because of the anaerobic vats that you have to use infused with nitrogen to be able to make an anaerobic bacteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (2h 18m 37s):\n",
      "So anyway, so I take three of their products. I take something called Glucose control, I take polyphenol and I take Akkermansia. Okay. And I think that's the\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 18m 45s):\n",
      "List. Okay. Yeah, I'll try and move through my list pretty quickly. I may miss one or two things and and I maybe we'll put the list someplace online and fill in any gaps. I definitely take AG AG, GAG one, you know, my typical ad read, I've been doing it since 2012. That's true. Take one or two servings a day. Three if I'm traveling. And I'll generally do that first thing in the morning or in the evening. For me, it's really about capping off the vitamin minerals that I might be lacking in my diet and also the whole adaptogen business I think, and polyphenols.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 19m 29s):\n",
      "And I'm a very interested in pendulum because part of the reason I take AG one is for the gut health aspect. I think just bowel movements are more where I'd want them. I mean it sounds kind of weird to talk about, but you just feel better when your gut motility is right. I feel like it adjusts my gut motility. So it's neither too fast nor too slow. So that's first and foremost, I take a quality fish oil, either the one that AG makes or Carlson's in liquid form that has that lemon flavoring. And I make sure I get above one gram per day of EPA. Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 20m 9s):\n",
      "So that's usually a tablespoon, sometimes two tablespoons. I make sure that I get enough D three typically from the dropper, 5,000 IU per day, approximately sometimes 3000, sometimes 7,000. I kind of play around that. And I test my blood levels. I also take methyl B12 and I also take Tonga Ali. So I take one capsule of that in the early part of the day that has lowered my sex hormone binding globulin, freeing up a bit more testosterone. It's why I like it. And I take a couple of green tea capsules in the morning. I drink here Roman mate. That's more of a stimulatory effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 20m 50s):\n",
      "And I take the NMN in powder form, sometimes NR as well. And again, if I run out of that, I tend to go long periods of time without, I use element as an electrolyte. So people are probably noticing, this is all pretty basic. I take, in my case, 10 grams of creatine monohydrate per day. I sometimes forget to take it. That's why I take 10 grams. I'll sometimes miss a day. Okay. And I certainly feel the effects of that in the gym because of the greater water volume in the muscles. But there are a lot of data on creatine monohydrate for sake of either maintaining or offsetting some of the cognitive dysfunction associated with sleep deprivation, maybe Aging altitude and some other things as well. And then for a few months I was playing around with, let's say nicotine gums.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 21m 36s):\n",
      "I stopped doing that. First of all, I was dipping it and I ended up lifting for an entire episode of the Lex Friedman podcast that I only realized later. So I stopped taking it also because it gave me a, a kind of a tick and cough when I wasn't chewing it. Hmm. And then I felt like I needed to chew it and it's a little too stimulatory for me before sleep. I take magnesium three eight, I'm really bullish on magnesium as well. Apigenin 50 milligrams, which is essentially chamomile extract and theanine. And occasionally I'll take 900 milligrams in Acetol also. Or instead I kind of mix those up and around.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 22m 16s):\n",
      "And then I use a quality whey protein as a protein replacement, that kind of thing. And I've played around with various things like Sheila G and you know, I'll sometimes get the sense that it's having an effect, but then I'll stop taking it for long periods of time. You know, there are very few things that I've stayed with for long periods of time and I basically just described what those are. You know, if ever someone were to design a supplement that would provide more energy all day long that wasn't caffeine, I'd probably look to that. But I ingest caffeine in the form of yerba mate and coffee. I've played around with caffeine tablets, you know, taking, you know, 50 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 22m 58s):\n",
      "I mentioned that only because it has a distinctly different feel than ingesting caffeine through liquid form. It feels stronger. And I don't know why that is. In fact, I, there's a very well-known podcaster who drinks peppermint tea and takes caffeine tablets as a way to, I don't know, drink peppermint tea, which sounds very nice and mellow, but also get the stimulant effect. So anyway, that's pretty much it. And then I do a lot of things as I know you do, mainly based on suggestions you've made about getting zone two, cardio rucking weight vest, walks and hikes three times a week, resistance training three times a week, cardiovascular training, one long, one medium, one short. And I try and hit the sauna and the cold one a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 23m 39s):\n",
      "And yeah, that's pretty much it. I think there are a bunch of other supplements that are really interesting and kind of fun to play with. If one wants to like 600 milligrams of Alpha GPC or 900 milligrams of Alpha GPC and a double espresso prior to a workout, you feel different. It's a stimulant, but I don't like to do that too often because of the increase in TMAO that occurs and then you have to take 600 milligrams of garlic to offset that increase. And you start getting into if, if we believe TMAO matters. Right? If you believe TMAO matters, I don't. Okay, great. Even better. I'll maybe skip the garlic. So things like that. I prefer to just eat garlic anyway, so there are a bunch of things like that Yeah. That are kind of fun to play with as pre-workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 24m 20s):\n",
      "But yeah, that's the core supplement regimen and it's the one I've stuck with for, gosh, at least 10 years. Or in the case of AG you more than, you know, more than that. So I should say, because any discussion around supplements, I think it's going to, you know, have people pricking up their ears to, okay, this is like a sales pitch or something. I absolutely want to go on record. The things you choose to do and not do are going to have much greater effect on your health span and Lifespan. That is the behavioral things, In particular sleep, exercise, nutrition, sunlight, et cetera, than any one supplement that you're going to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 24m 59s):\n",
      "So I do view supplements, I think through the appropriate lens, which is that they are indeed a supplement. They are not necessary, many of them are simply sufficient to serve as an insurance policy or to augment mental and physical health. Maybe Longevity in ways that make it worthwhile, given my disposable income that I want to devote to supplements. But I don't think you need\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (2h 25m 27s):\n",
      "Them. Yeah. I'll go even more extreme on that statement. Everything we have talked about on this podcast today, whether it be NR, NAD, NMN, thera, human Magnesium, this supplement, that supplement, all of that stuff while potentially mattering, I would put in the category of, was the Titanic serving lobster or steak? Look, I I, I like steak more than lobster. That's a relative discussion. Exercise, sleep, nutrition, emotional health is the question of what was the heading of the Titanic.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (2h 26m 7s):\n",
      "Okay? So I just want people to understand the magnitude of what we're talking about. How you eat, how you sleep, how you train, and how you take care of your mental health is the equivalent of what direction was the Titanic going with respect to the iceberg. All this supplement bullshit that we just talked about is equivalent to were they serving lobster or were they serving steak? And was the band playing this song or that song? I'm not saying those things don't matter, but just put them in the context of the direction the Titanic is going.\n",
      "\n",
      "0 (2h 26m 41s):\n",
      "Okay. So I completely agree with you. Exercise, sleep, nutrition, and emotional health not listed in any particular order. Peter and I both completely agree. Those are the critical four before we close. and NR NMN and a D and NAD, In particular. How do we view this? Is it a pathway that we should be focusing on in terms of supplementation or infusions for sake of extending our life? My answer on that is no.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (2h 27m 8s):\n",
      "Yeah, I would say the same. You know, I, I don't remember who said this, but someone, maybe it was Nasem, EB said, don't tell me what you think. Show me what's in your portfolio. Like meaning people who pontificate about this stock versus that stock. He's kind of like, assuming it was him that said this, he's like, okay, I, I don't care what you're telling me. Tell me what you own that's gonna show me your conviction. So through that lens, look, I'll show you my conviction on exercise. I'll show you what I do. I'll show you my conviction on sleep. This is what I do. I'll show you my conviction on all these other things. I mean, I don't take these supplements full stop. I don't take 'em 'cause I can't afford, it's not that I can't afford 'em, it's not that they're any inconvenience to me to take 'em.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 (2h 27m 49s):\n",
      "I passionately do not believe they do anything for me. And why would I waste time, money, anything on something that I really don't believe makes a difference. Now again, I am always happy to be proven wrong and I am very happy to say that two years from now, five years from now, we could be doing this exercise again. And in the presence of new information, maybe I'm not taking rapamycin and maybe I am fistful, you know, NR and NMN possible I will, I will reserve the right to change my mind for the rest of my life in the presence of new data. But as it stands today, I do not take these supplements and I have no foreseeable plan to do so until information changes.\n",

So good to sit down with you again and talk science, talk health, and in this case talk about the supplements that we're not going to take in addition to the ones that we do take. We will do this again sometime very soon, hopefully\n",

Aquí está un resumen detallado de los puntos clave y recomendaciones discutidos:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Categorías de Enfoques para la Longevidad**:\n",
      "   - **Hacer y No Hacer**: Incluye ejercicio regular, entrenamiento de resistencia, y una dieta adecuada. También se recomienda conocer la genética personal para tomar decisiones informadas.\n",
      "   - **Calorías y Metabolismo**: Se discuten intervenciones como la restricción calórica y el uso de fármacos como la rapamicina para reducir la actividad de mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), que está asociada con el crecimiento celular y el envejecimiento.\n",
      "   - **Vías Celulares Específicas**: Aquí es donde entra el NAD, que ha sido propuesto como un objetivo para mejorar la longevidad.\n",
      "   - **Enfoques Holísticos**: Incluye una combinación de todas las estrategias posibles, aunque esto es menos común.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **NAD y Sirtuinas**:\n",
      "   - **Función del NAD**: Es crucial para el transporte de electrones en las células, lo que es esencial para la producción de energía.\n",
      "   - **Sirtuinas**: Son proteínas que utilizan NAD para reparar el ADN. Se ha sugerido que la activación de las sirtuinas podría mejorar la longevidad al mejorar la reparación del ADN, aumentar la biogénesis mitocondrial y reducir las células senescentes.\n",
      "   - **Resveratrol**: Fue inicialmente promocionado como un activador de sirtuinas, pero los estudios no han demostrado consistentemente que extienda la vida.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suplementación de NAD**:\n",
      "   - **NR (nicotinamide riboside) y NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide)**: Son precursores del NAD. NR puede cruzar directamente la membrana celular, mientras que NMN necesita ser convertido en NR para entrar en las células.\n",
      "   - **Evidencia de Eficacia**: Los estudios en humanos han mostrado resultados mixtos. Algunos estudios sugieren beneficios menores en la reducción de grasa hepática y mejora en la disposición de glucosa, pero estos resultados no son clínicamente significativos.\n",
      "   - **Infusiones de NAD**: Aunque algunas personas reportan sentirse mejor después de las infusiones, no hay evidencia clara de que extiendan la vida.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Recomendaciones Generales**:\n",
      "   - **Ejercicio, Sueño, Nutrición y Salud Emocional**: Son los pilares fundamentales para la salud y longevidad. Los suplementos deben considerarse como un complemento, no como una solución principal.\n",
      "   - **Rapamicina**: Aunque no es un suplemento, es uno de los pocos fármacos que ha mostrado extender la vida en modelos animales. Sin embargo, su uso en humanos para este propósito aún está en investigación.\n",
