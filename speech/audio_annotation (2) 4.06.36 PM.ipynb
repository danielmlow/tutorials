        "1. Write `True` after `practice_run` below to try it. \n",
        "2. Click the play button (or shift+Return)\n",
        "3. You will be prompted to sign in to your google drive, enter the email associated to your Drive account you saved the folder in.\n",
        "4. After clicking on the play button, it will prompt you to enter your initials. Then the different audio files will be played in turn. Follow instructions to annotate each audio file.\n",
        "5. Write `False` after `practice_run` to annotate and save your annotations.\n",
        "5. After annotating, share the `output` folder with me.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important:\n",
        "- Set your computer's sound volume to the highest your comfortable with (to listen to background noise) and DO NOT change throughout annotation to compare all audio samples under similar conditions (e.g., use same speaker/headset at the same volume throughout).\n",
        "- **Save and quit:** You can save and quit at any time by typing \"quit\" (it will save your work in `output` folder). When you press play again, it will automatically start where you left off, no need to do anything other than press the play button and enter the same initial you did the last time. \n",
        "- **Edit response:** the idea is you don't review your answers. Do not open the output file after annotating. \n",
        "  - In the case of a typo, you can edit your responses for an audio file you are currently editing. Just type quit. And click on play button again. It will repeat the current audio annotation you just quit so you can redo your annotations for that audio file (prior annotations will be saved). \n",
        "  - If you want to edit the annotations for the prior audio file (e.g., you notice a big mistake/typo), let me know the file number (above the audio display) and what your edit is and I'll make the edit, but don't review your answers beyond the last one. "
